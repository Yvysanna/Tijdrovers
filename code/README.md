Every algorithm can be found in the main code folder
All class definitions are found in `code/objects`.

The `results` directory contains all the output and visualizations from running the program. Firstly, the histogram
in `baseline.png` contains the number of maluspoints across 200 runs using an old random algorithm, which was made
in an earlier phase of the project. Next, a schedule of every student can be found with the name
`schedule{points}_{time}.csv`, with the points being the amount of total maluspoints, and the time being the time
at which the algorithm finished running. It contains every activity for every student, and in which timeslot and classroom it is given.
