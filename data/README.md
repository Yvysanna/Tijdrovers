The data in the parent data folder was extracted from [mprog.nl](https://theorie.mprog.nl/cases/lectures-en-lesroosters).
`classrooms.csv` contains a list of every classroom and its capacity, `courses.csv` contains every course and the number
of lectures, tutorials and lab sessions. A maximum number of students per tutorial and lab group is also given, and the
number of expected enrolments, although this last figure was not used in this project. `students.csv` contains a list of
students along with every course in which they are enrolled. From this list, `enrolments.csv` was created, which lists
the number of actual enrolments per course. All of this data is bundled in `data.xlsx`.
